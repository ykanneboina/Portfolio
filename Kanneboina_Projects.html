                        documentation</a>. 
                       For this project, I created a circuit that can identify the ideal aquarium for a pufferfish and goldfish. There were three inputs: food type, cleaning schedule, and type of fish. Each input was represented by a different LED. The output, which was whether the aquarium is safe or not, is also represented by an LED. The aquarium would be safe only for two different combinations of inputs. After I created the design brief, design specifications, and the truth table, I created a simulation of the circuit on Multisim and tested it against my truth table to make sure it works as intended. Next, I built the physical version of this circuit with IC gates, jumper wires, and a breadboard. One challenge that I faced in this project was that I had to figure out how to translate the truth table into a circuit. I overcame this challenge by testing out different logic gates on Multisim. For this circuit to be implemented in real life, I could have sensors to get the inputs instead of LEDs.

Working in groups helped us divide the work among ourselves but also collaborate to create a unique program. My role in this project was mainly to research the applications of Java while my partner focused on the applications of C++. While we researched our respective languages, we frequently collaborated and talked about our findings so both members of the team learned C++ and Java. Finally, we created a tic tac toe game with C++ and Java. Through our project, we found that C++ and Java are both used for object-oriented programs, have the same primitive data types, and they always start with a main() function. However, C++ is different from Java because its classes aren't important in C++, there are not many readily available libraries and is normally used for hardware projects. One challenge was that the time constraint was only around 2 weeks and we had to quickly learn the differences and comparisons between the two languages.</h2>

We worked in a group of three people and my partners were Akamai Wong and Donna Price. One of the obstacles that we faced was that not all of us could work on the program at once. In order to overcome this obstacle, we needed to effectively divide up the jobs. For example, if someone was coding during a specific class period, the other two partners were either researching about chatbots and completing <a class= "white" target = "_blank" href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/11zjINGQESmf5aKUo3jkBpF5RGO346ESfG3_uSoC8FT8/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a>.

Each group consisted of three people and each of us had to separate build two of our own projectiles. This would result in each group having a total of 6 projectiles. We were working in groups so that we could give each other advice on what types of designs might work better on our projectiles.  We had two different launch days and on each of these launch days, each of us would launch one of our projectiles. Based on the results of our first launch day, we would create a new projectile to launch on the second launch day. For the first launch day, I designed a projectile (as shown in the left picture) made out of yellow construction paper, a wide nose, and three short wings. This projectile only traveled 96 feet. Based on this performance, I created a new projectile for the second launch day. This new projectile (as shown in the right picture) had a longer body made out of printing paper instead of construction paper in order to decrease the weight, long and narrow wings, and a sharp and narrow cone. This new projectile traveled 141 feet. One challenge that I face in this project was choosing what shape my wings and cone were supposed to be. I overcame this challenge by researching what shapes were used on real rockets.</h2>
