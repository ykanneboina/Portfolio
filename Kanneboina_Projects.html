                   <h2>  Name: Scratch Project</h2> 
                    Course: CSE (Computer Science Engineering)<br/>
                    Duration: Around 1 week (August 30 - September 7)<br/>
                    Objective: To create a game or story using block coding in Scratch<br/>
                    Type of Project: Partner Project<br/>
                    <p class="font_bigger">The goal of this project was to create a game using block coding on a website called Scratch. For this project, my partner was Audrey Kang. My partner and I made our game similar to an escape room. In this game, the player had to get a character called Gobo out of multiple rooms using clues given by the game. The clues were given to the player in the form of riddles. We also used <a class= "white" href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEbeghMiobB4aAftZyVOqbACUZIHq1jInXhbxxeCBRY/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a> to keep track of our progress. We also created a <a class = "white" href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_n3EpxFC8__Z2lWdHpNc29PNXM/view?usp=sharing">flowchart</a> to make the skeleton of our game. In this project, my main job was to keep the documentation up to date and help with the coding. Through this project, I learned how to improve and think of new ideas with my partner. One of the challenges we met was making the game user-friendly, which we solved by relating it to games we have played before. I also learned how to code in Scratch. This is how I also learned how to make a game user-friendly and entertaining. </h2>

                   <h2>  Name: Image Manipulation</h2> 
                    Course: CSE (Computer Science Engineering)<br/>
                    Duration: Around 3 weeks (March 6 - March 25)<br/>
                    Objective: To manipulate four images of our choice so that it meets the needs of a client<br/>
                    Type of Project: Partner Project<br/>
                    <p class="font_bigger">The goal of this project was to manipulate four images of our choice depending the needs of our client. We chose client number 1. The client wanted images manipulated for a good cause(in our case we choose animals). The requirements for this client are <a class= "white" href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/13rx023cIhSfNuoufztAtgXPf3yq15NH6V8RnLLuPkxs/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a> My partner, Donna Prince, and I had to follow instructions and we were graded by a rubric. For our images, we made borders with yellow triangles in the corner. We gave the client an option for the borders. They could have chosen purple with a thin grey line or a green border with a thin red line. We also changed the parts of the picture that were originally black to blue ad the parts that were originally white to light pink. Our client also wanted a logo so my partner and I created a logo and pasted it at the top right. To make the message clear, we also gave a message at the bottom. For this project we had to document our progress neatly.</h2>
