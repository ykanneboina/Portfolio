                   <h2>  Name: Scratch Project</h2> 
                    Course: CSE (Computer Science Engineering)<br/>
                    Duration: Around 1 week (August 30 - September 7)<br/>
                    Objective: To create a game or story using block coding in Scratch<br/>
                    Type of Project: Partner Project<br/>
                    <p class="font_bigger">The goal of this project was to create a game using block coding on a website called Scratch. For this project, my partner was Audrey Kang. My partner and I made our game similar to an escape room. In this game, the player had to get a character called Gobo out of multiple rooms using clues given by the game. The clues were given to the player in the form of riddles. We also used <a class= "white" href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEbeghMiobB4aAftZyVOqbACUZIHq1jInXhbxxeCBRY/edit?usp=sharing">documentation</a> to keep track of our progress. We also created a <a class = "white" href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_n3EpxFC8__Z2lWdHpNc29PNXM/view?usp=sharing">flowchart</a> to make the skeleton of our game. In this project, my main job was to keep the documentation up to date and help with the coding. Through this project, I learned how to improve and think of new ideas with my partner. One of the challenges we met was making the game user-friendly, which we solved by relating it to games we have played before. I also learned how to code in Scratch. This is how I also learned how to make a game user-friendly and entertaining. </h2>
