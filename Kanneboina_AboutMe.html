                    <h4>Hi, welcome to my online portfolio, I am Yoga Kanneboina. I am a sophomore attending Dublin High School. I aspire to be a robotics engineer. I first became interested in robotics in fourth grade when I found out about Lego Mindstorm. I enjoyed building a mechanism that in some way could help others. I have always loved building robots by coding their software as well as building their hardware which is why I want to become a robotics engineer. I want to eventually help other people by building robots. In order to achieve this goal, I plan to take engineering courses throughout high school. I have started doing this by taking Computer Science Principles in my freshman year and Principles of Engineering in my sophomore year. I plan to take AP Computer Science in my junior year and Digital Electronics during my senior year. I am currently in the Dublin High School Engineering Academy which helps me get many engineering opporunities out side of school. After high school, I want to go to a four-year college with a robotics major. Currently, the classes that I am taking are Honors Chemistry, English, AP European History, Precalculus / Trigonometry, Principles of Engineering, and Spanish 3. </h4>

                    <h4 >In order to be a robotics engineer, it is important to be a problem solver, a fast learner, and persistent. Last year, I took a Computer Science class for my elective. In this class, we had to code in many languages including Python, CSS, HTML, Java, SQL, and PHP. Since we had to learn these languages and do projects in these languages all in one school year, I learned how to pick up coding languages quickly. This class also taught me how to be persistent when facing problems with coding. While coding has taught me important lessons in engineering, working with hardware and other people has also taught me numerous things. For example being on my robotics team forced me to cooperate with others and see things from other perspectives.</h4>

                    <h4>My extracurriculars include dance and robotics. I have been dancing a classical Indian dance called Bharathanatyam for ten years. Through this, I have been able to do many things, such as perform for a cancer research society and teach kids under that age of seven how to dance. As mentioned before I have been doing robotics ever since fourth grade and I have been on a VEX robotics team for two years. By being on a robotics team, I found that it was the perfect combination of coding, designing, and building. I decided that since I knew how to do robotics, I could teach others and get little kids interested in the STEM field. To do this, I volunteered to help introduce robotics to girl scouts and show them how engineering can change lives. I decided to specifically teach girl scouts because when I first joined robotics I noticed that there was an obvious lack of girls. I wanted to encourage other young girls to see if they were interested in engineering which is why I wanted to volunteer for girl scouts. I am also president of a club called ECO in my high school. Through this club that helps spread awareness about things harming the environment, I learned how to organize events such as fundraising and how to be a leader.</h4>
