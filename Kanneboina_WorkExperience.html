                    <h4 class = "height">As I am currently in the Dublin High School Engineering Academy, I have been able to go to many field trips to engineering companies and listen to experienced guest speakers. One field trip that I have attended through the Dublin High School Engineering Program is NASA. This was a very insightful experience because it taught me the different areas of aerospace engineering. For example, I was able to look at an old rocket from the inside and understand how it worked. The tour guides also explain how they prototyped and designed the rocket as well as what factors they took into account when building the rocket. I learned that when designing and manufacturing the rocket, they have to take into account the cost efficiency, effects on the environment, durability, and functionality. Another interesting thing I saw when I visited NASA was the robots that they were building. This was interesting for many reasons, one being that I never knew saw a professional robotics lab before coming to NASA. This was very impactful for me because I am currently on a robotics team. We were able to meet one of the designers for a robot that utilized artificial intelligence. He explained that the purpose of this robot was to explore outer space terrains. What made this robot special was that it was able to assess its own battery level and could determine whether it should start heading back to charge itself or if it had enough battery to keep exploring. I was very intrigued by this robot because not only did it require good build quality to withstand unknown terrains, but it also required complex coding. This was intriguing to me because it combined two of my favorite things in engineering which are coding and building. Through this experience, I was able to gain more knowledge about the aerospace engineering field and the different types of jobs offered at NASA.

                        One of the guest speakers that came into my Principles of Engineering class was Aaron Pomerantz. Mr.Pomerantz was a bioengineer that traveled to many places including the Amazon rainforest so that he could study organisms ranging from insects to mammals. One of the devices that he was able to bioengineer was a portable microscope. He explained that this was very useful for bioengineers when they are conducting studies because many bioengineers are not in a lab when they are working. They are often outdoors, which makes it harder to use bulky microscopes to observe their specimen. Another device that he bioengineered is a portable gene sequencer. He explained how this would help bioengineers obtain useful information in a quick fashion. This guest speaker was very eye-opening to me because before this, I was not aware that biology and engineering could be so closely integrated. This guest speaker was impactful to me because it made me consider to be a bioengineer in the future as I was very interested in the things that Mr.Pomerantz was able to do in his job as a bioengineer.

                        During the summer before my sophomore year, I was able to go to the SAP summer high school orientation. This was an event that SAP hosted to give high schoolers hands-on experience by teaching us how to use a Raspberry Pi, how to use the SAP Cloud (a customer interface that showed the outputs of the sensors connected to Raspberry Pi), and how to sell to customers. This was a very hands-on orientation that taught me how to breadboard, code, and informed me about the sales side on engineering. On the last day, we presented our work to people in the SAP Digital Interconnect. Afterward, we were able to ask them questions about the different positions in SAP. Overall, I learned more about how a raspberry pi works, different roles in a team, the Internet of Things, and the different teams in SAP.
