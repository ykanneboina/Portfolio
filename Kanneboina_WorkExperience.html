                    <h4 class = "height"> As I am currently in the Dublin High School Engineering Academy, I have been able to go to many field trips to engineering companies and listen 
                        to experienced guest speakers. During my freshman year, I went on a field trip to SAP. Here, I was able to talk to employees of SAP from different departments. 
                        Through this trip, I understood that one of the most integral parts of working in a team is being able to efficiently convey information to people of different experience 
                        levels. For example, oftentimes, a software engineer must communicate with an employee in finance in order to understand design constraints.

                    NASA Ames Research Center 
                </h3>
                        <h4 class = "height"> One field trip that I have attended through the Dublin High School Engineering Program is NASA Ames Research Center. This was a very 
                        insightful experience because it taught me the different areas of aerospace engineering. For example, I was able to look at an old rocket from the inside and 
                        understand how it worked. The tour guides also explain how they prototyped and designed the rocket as well as what factors they took into account when building the
                        rocket. I learned that when designing and manufacturing the rocket, they have to take into account the cost efficiency, effects on the environment, durability, and 
                        functionality. Another interesting thing I saw when I visited NASA Ames was the robots that they were building. This was interesting for many reasons, one being that
                        I never knew saw a professional robotics lab before coming to NASA Ames. This was very impactful for me because I am currently on a robotics team. We were able to 
                        meet one of the designers for a robot that utilized artificial intelligence. He explained that the purpose of this robot was to explore outer space terrains. What
                        made this robot special was that it was able to assess its own battery level and could determine whether it should start heading back to charge itself or if it had 
                        enough battery to keep exploring. I was very intrigued by this robot because not only did it require good build quality to withstand unknown terrains, but it also 
                        required complex coding. This was intriguing to me because it combined two of my favorite things in engineering which are coding and building. Through this experience
                        , I was able to gain more knowledge about the aerospace engineering field and the different types of jobs offered at NASA Ames. </h4>

                <h4 class = "height"> In hopes of learning more about the college application process and more about my future in college, I went on a field trip to UC Davis. Here, I learned more about their research programs, academic courses, and 
                        student body. Learning about their engineering research and programs was one of the factors that helped me decide to major in biomedical engineering.

                       <h4 class = "height"> Another field trip that interested me
                        was when I went to Lawrance Livermore National Laboratories(LLNL) during my junior year. When I took honors chemistry during my sophomore year, I learned about 
                        fusion. Since I was interested in learning more about how exactly fusion is created, I signed up for this field trip during my junior year. During this field trip, 
                        I was able to go on a tour around the Lawrance Livermore National Laboratoriesâ€™ office campus. In this tour, I learned a lot about how LLNL is trying to attain 
                        fusion in order to have more efficient electricity-based technology. Although the beams of light are only shot for a few seconds, employees at LLNL work for hours 
                        and put a lot of money in order to build the pathway to guide the beams that have to hit a very small target. Through this field trip, I understood how much work is 
                        put into trying to create fusion.  </h4>

                        biomedical engineering. I learned about how this company manufactured assays, which are used to measure the amount of substance present in a biological or chemical process. 
                        I also learned how technology is used to speed up testing and manufacturing processes. </h4>

                        In March 2021, I went to the S.H.E. Leads STEM Summit led by Junior Achievement. This even taught me how to deal with imposter syndrome, an occurrence that many women 
                        in STEM face. I also learned more about how to reach out and be resourceful in an environment where I might be one of the few women in engineering.

                    <br/>
                    <h4 class = "height">
                        During my time in the engineering program, I have met a number of industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers. One of the guest speakers that came into my Principles of Engineering class was Aaron Pomerantz. Mr.Pomerantz was a bioengineer that traveled to many places including the Amazon rainforest so that he could study organisms ranging from insects to mammals. One of the devices that he was able to bioengineer was a portable microscope. He explained that this was very useful for bioengineers when they are conducting studies because many bioengineers are not in a lab when they are working. They are often outdoors, which makes it harder to use bulky microscopes to observe their specimen. Another device that he bioengineered is a portable gene sequencer. He explained how this would help bioengineers quickly obtain useful information. This guest speaker was very eye-opening to me because before this, I was not aware that biology and engineering could be so closely integrated. This guest speaker was impactful to me because it made me consider to be a bioengineer in the future as I was very interested in the things that Mr.Pomerantz was able to do in his job as a bioengineer. Another guest speaker that I enjoyed was Shawn Mehaffey, who presented in my Advanced Placement Computer Science Applications class. Mr.Mehaffey was a systems analyst who worked in Chevron. When he was presenting to my class, he talked about the evolution of technology and how machines today have developed over time. He also explained how the technology worked twenty years ago. Listening to his presentation helped me learn where the computers we use today originated from. This sparked my interest in learning about the material and work that goes into engineering a computer and how far technology today has come. He also talked to us about his pathway in Chevron by explaining how he was first hired and eventually was able to work as a systems analyst in Chevron. This helped me understand more about how an engineer can advance to higher positions in a company such as Chevron.

                        As I am part of the engineering academy, I was able to partake in the mentorship program which allows me to connect to two mentors. My mentorsâ€™ names are Erin Chia and Jose Cadena. Jose Cadena is a computer scientist and Erin Chia is a bioengineer/manager at Bio-Rad. These two mentors have helped me tremendously by giving me information about their career and college experiences. The most important thing I learned from Jose Cadena was that computer scientists have to communicate with all types of employees such as scientists, lawyers, and hardware engineers. I learned from Erin Chia how to conduct myself in an interview and how to build an outstanding resume. Overall, these two mentors have taught me numerous skills that are helping me stay on track to be a bioengineer.

                        During the summer before my sophomore year, I was able to go to the SAP summer high school orientation. This was an event that SAP hosted to give high schoolers hands-on experience by teaching us how to use a Raspberry Pi, how to use the SAP Cloud (a customer interface that showed the outputs of the sensors connected to Raspberry Pi), and how to sell to customers. This was a very hands-on orientation that taught me how to breadboard, code, and informed me about the sales side on engineering. On the last day, we presented our work to people in the SAP Digital Interconnect. Afterward, we were able to ask them questions about the different positions in SAP. Overall, I learned more about how a Raspberry Pi works, different roles in a team, the Internet of Things, and the different teams in SAP.
